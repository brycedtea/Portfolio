# Portfolio

## MERN Stack Developer Portfolio

### Description
This is the latest version of my developer portfolio built with the React and Bootstrap. This is a Single-page application that is packed with a ton of eye-catching feautures. This website is connected to a MongoDB database and features full CRUD functionality. Being a junior developer inspired me to create a portfolio that stands out and accurately respresents who I am.
